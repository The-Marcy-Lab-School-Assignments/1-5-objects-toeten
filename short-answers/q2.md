# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
When we say something is "pass by value" we are making a copy of a variable's value. Its essentially like creating a photocopy of a document and giving it to someone; both the original piece of paper and the photocopy have the same information on them, but changing the copy will not affect the original. 
When you pass a variable by reference, you are copying a reference to the original variable's location in memory. Its similar to giving someone editing abilities on your Google Document. You both have the same document, but any changes made by the other person will directly affect your version.
