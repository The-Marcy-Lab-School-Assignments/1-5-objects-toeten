# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
A "shallow" clone is a copy of an object where only the immediate properties of an object are copied, but the nested objects within it are still passed by referenced. Therefore, any changes made to the nested objects in the cloned object will also affect the original object. 

# Teacher Feedback

Not just the immediate properties, any property with a value whose data type is a primitive value!
