# Question
When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer
You use an array when you have a set of primitive values that are similar and that you want in a certain order. For example, you can use an array to gather all the cars in a commuter parking lot.
`const cars = ["Honda Civic", "Ford Taurus", "Kia Soul"]`

 You use an object when you need to gather key-value pairs that refer to the same entity. For example, if you wanted to list the cars in the parking lot AND aspects about them (such as their color and license plate number.)
`const cars = {
   car1 {
    manufacturer: "honda"
    color: "red"
    plateNumber: "223J6"
         },
    car2 {
    manufacturer: "ford"
    color: "blue"
    plateNumber: "665HAQ"
         }
    }`
