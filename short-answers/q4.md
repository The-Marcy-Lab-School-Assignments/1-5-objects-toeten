# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation." It is a data representation format used to transmit data between servers and applications, as well as store configuration files in a way that is easy for both humans and machines to read.
The example above does not use double quotes around the keys, making it invalid JSON.
